  And at last, but by far not the least, I give my deepest thanks to my family for being so loving and supportive of my endeavors. In particular: 爸，妈，我好感谢 — 知道我对你们的爱没有条件!

P.S. Don’t forget to back up your disk drives regularly, everybody! A big thanks to M3 Recovery for saving a large proportion of my lost files, when DiskWarrior could not, on my Transcend JetDrive (it all of a sudden crashed on my MacBook without warning).
