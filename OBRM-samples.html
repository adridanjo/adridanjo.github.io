- (4:10) Astor Piazzolla — “Adiós Nonino” (Muerte del Angel, 1997)

  One of the first memories I have of my time spent in Argentina is this “Bajaneando por hay” YouTube video. The woman who hosted me for CouchSurfing showed me various videos about Argentinian culture, amongst which this one. The sampled song stood out to me. (The next day, we went to Mostaza -- I didn’t like it very much). 

  When I was 15, I discovered the compositions of Astor Piazzolla, and instantly fell in love. In High School, we played a version of “Adiós Nonino” (loosely adapted from the Escalandrum version) in the jazz combo. In Argentina, I ended up seeing Escalandrum (lead by Daniel Piazzolla, Astor’s grandson) play live at the Konex center. (I would find myself there half a year later for a cybersecurity conference, but that is a story for a mother day).

  What a struggle it was for me to understand the spoken Spanish then!

  In this song I describe Argentinian pizza. I have never had anything quite like them since. 10/10 would recommend, you have to try it to confirm the claims I make in this song. 

  Of course, I went to Argentina in the first place because I was so disillusioned by my then-motivations of pursuing science. I had just finished undergrad, and was disillusioned in my identity invarious ways. I ended up spending eight months there, having completed zero of the three goals I had for myself when I left. 

  
B4 - Two Of Us 
  
- (0:09) ？？？— “蓝瘦香菇竟然被人唱成歌了，好魔性，太好听了！” (Youtube) (Chinese IP sucks, I searched for hours unsuccessfully to find the name of the artist who made this version.) 
- (0:32) Tim Maia — “Where Is My Other Half” (The Existential Soul of Tim Maia, 2012)
- (1:00) Bruno Mars — “Treasure” (Unorthodox Jukebox, 2012)

- (4:03) Un Trois — “Just The Two Of Us” (The Lynbrook Music Project, 2013)

  This mix is all about pervasive cis-heteronormative expectations about love and romance, expectations that were instilled very profoundly in me from grade school onward. They were absolutely toxic, and in so many of my early relationship, I was toxic to my partners. I had my fair share of romances, a good number of them them ending in absolute heartbreak. Allison, if you are reading this, I know it’s been already so many years — I’m really sorry for hurting you so deeply back then. 

  “Zanga não quero te ver mais assim / tome juízo, me faça feliz …”


B5 - Underworld 
  
- (0:00) Robin Koerts — “Ray Brown Plays Super Mario” (Youtube, 2019) 
- (0:14) Ana Tijoux — “La Nueva Condena” (1977, 2010) 

  It’s been a while since the idea of making a “chill remix” of the underworld theme in Super Mario Bros. came to mind. It was just a matter of time of finding the perfect samples to make the track. Robin Koerts’ “Ray Brown Plays” series on YouTube is seriously so, so hilarious. I highly recommend checking out “Actual Proof.” And Ana Tijoux! There’ll be more commentary later about her music. 

  “La nueva condena / Una cadena que envenena hasta las venas / Que solo llena la pena nada la quema / Solo te suena …”

  
B6 Desilusão 
  
- (0:01) Weyes Blood — “A Lot’s Gonna Change” (Titanic Rising, 2019)
- (1:45) Eddie Kendricks — “Just Memories” (People… Hold On, 1972)
- (1:52) Kendrick Lamar — “u” (To Pimp A Butterfly, 2015)
- (2:00) Mac DeMarco — “Chamber Of Reflection” (Salad Days, 2014)

- (3:33) Theo Katman — “Plain Jane Heroin” (Heartbreak Hits, 2017)
- (3:50) duendita — “Hurt so Much” (direct line to My Creator, 2018)
- (4:56) Adrianne Lenker — “Carolina” (b-sides, 2014)

  I have been through a couple of depressive bouts in my life, the most severe one being from August to December 2019. The creeping fear that all good things in life have disappeared from you forever, it’s a really shitty place to be. 

  Many of the songs above helped me through the tough times. Weyes Blood’s Titanic Rising album helped immensely. Big Thief’s catalog, too, listening to certain albums front-to-back was a daily habit. My deepest thanks to Kelly and Hunte for introducing me to these artists. 

  My struggles have been difficult, but I realize that weathering through them has given me a confidence of inner strength, and a deep conviction of who I am deep down inside. With that said, I would not wish on anybody to experience the depths of despair that I have. 


M1 - Na Boca Do Sol (feat. Goldie and oddity)
  
- (0:00) Death — “Let The World Turn” (…For The Whole World To See, 2009)
- (0:43) Marcus Strickland's Twi-Life feat. Chris Dave — “DRIVE” (YouTube, 2016)
- (4:37) The Dave Brubeck Quartet and the New York Philharmonic — “Dialogues for Jazz Combo and Orchestra: II Andante” (Bernstein Plays Brubeck Plays Bernstein 1961)

  The TS Elliot quote in the beginning  — one that helped me through dark hours — is from Jeannette Winterson’s memoir, Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal. (Recommended by Vishnu — thank you!) 

  Something really odd happened to me in the summer of 2019 — all of a sudden, all my linguistic struggles just evaporated. There was a facility with which I could comprehend and speak. Whereas I struggled so much with Spanish in Argentina, all of a sudden I seemed to be fluent. From listening to Brazilian 70s Samba Soul music (obsessively, may I say), I picked up a bit of Portuguese. 

  When I heard this song for the first time, I fell in love. The interpretation I had of the phrase “cidade do interior” was a bit more abstract than I think the lyricist Arthur Verocai intended. This song is about the “city of internal thought” that I have lived with throughout most of my life. 

  I would later discover that this linguistic facility that I have experienced is a characteristic of bipolar disorder. 


M2 - Dearest Technology Brothers
  
- (0:00) Steven Universe — “Little Butler” (Youtube, 2016)
- (0:05) EECS Student — “EECS EECS” (eecseecs.com, 2016)

- (3:59) MonoNeon — "DUMP TRUMP, WE DON'T WANT HIM" (YouTube, 2016)
- (4:17) Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse — “Leap Of Faith” (YouTube, 2019)

  Now having lived in Berkeley five out of the last seven years, watching Berkeley and Oakland and San Francisco transform before my eyes has filled me with a strong angst. The gentrification here is so palpable. There is an extraordinary housing shortage, and the Young Urban Professionals moving in tend not to spend their free time integrating themselves into the already existing community, but rather keep to themselves.

  To all in the tech industry who are willing to listen, please be more mindful of those around you whose livelihood may have been well affected by the mass influx of tech workers. Stop avoiding the wealth inequality that exists right before your eyes. It’s not uniquely your fault, but you have the power to make a difference.

M3 - 性 (Interludio) (feat. Lovin' MC)
  
- (0:00) 神奇宝贝 — “我是谁” (YouTube, 2019)
- (0:05) Slave — “Just a Touch of Love” (Just A Touch Of Love, 1979)
- (0:06) Higher Brothers — “Isabellae” (Black Cab, 2017)
- (0:06) 朱哲琴 — “草原之夜” (新乐府, 2004)

  MaSiWei’s verse in “Isabellae” is fire. Hands down. 

  This year, I have been uncovering both ethnic and racial identities. Part of the former is learning more Mandarin. It turns out, in Mandarin, the word for “gender” is the same as the word for “sex”, (both biological sex and fornication): 性 (xìng). I find it particularly interesting that the compound word for “character/nature/disposition/what’s fundamentally deep down” is 性格 (xìng gé). 

  This was going to be a longer song, as I had a couple of verses of lyrics in Mandarin written up, exploring themes of being Chinese American growing up in California, my parents’ “Journey To The West” from China to the US, my rejection of my ethnic heritage as a kid, tangential experiences in high school and in college, and finally, this very recent process of reconciling the conflicts between being both transgender, and Chinese. Due to time constraints (in multiple senses of the phrase) I could only prepare this shorter version of the rap, though in the foreseeable future I plan on releasing a complete version. 

  My mother would always hum the tune behind 草原之夜, “来来来来来 。。。“ I really enjoy the version sung by 朱哲琴, as I find it quite fitting that a female voice sings those lyrics.


M4 - La Nueva Coalición 
  
- (0:00) Incognito — “Need To Know” (Tribes Vibes and Scribes, 1992)
- (0:03) Ana Tijoux — “Crisis de un MC” (1977, 2010)
- (0:03) Clodomiro Montes Jr — “Merengue Guiro with Scraper (LP305)” (YouTube, 2018)
- (0:56) Kool And The Gang — “Summer Madness” (Light of Worlds, 1974)
- (2:31) Rick and Morty — “The Search For Meaning (YouTube, 2017)

  Ana Tijoux’s 1977 is one of my favorite albums of all time. This song is a nod to the raps, lyrics, and beats of the album. Si estás leyendo esto, Anita, sabí que agradezco un montón todo que haces!

  Chinos, Latinos, Árabes, Negritos — basta con la lucha entre nosotros mismo! Tendríamos que juntarnos para confrontar las fuerzas colonialistas que todavía existen y nos afectan hoy en día. 

  I love Rick and Morty. Thanks again, Livi, for introducing me. 

  “… once you get through that terrifying threshold of accepting that, then, every place is the center of the universe, and every moment is the most important moment, and every thing is the meaning of life.”


M5 - Orgulho
  
- (0:00) Joe Hisaishi — “Kondamas” (Princess Mononoke Sountrack, 1997)
- (1:15) Digable Planets — “What Cool Breezes Do” (Reachin’ (A New Refutation Of Time And Space), 1993) 

  Princess Mononoke is my favorite film of all time. The moral ambiguity of the characters how there are good and bad aspects in every last character; the development of the relationship between Ashitaka and San from their preternatural affinity to their ultimate intimacy before death; the narrative arc of San’s hero’s journey and coming-of-age — so much of this movie means so much to me. 

  The main beat behind this track was something I made one afternoon maybe four or five years ago with my high school classmate Shouvik Neogi. I had started writing lyrics for this rap summer 2019, after having clawed out of my penultimate depressive bout. Meditation really helped. Certain life philosophies that I hold are reflected in the song’s lyrics. 

  I tried really hard to sample Lalah Hathaway in this! Both the original and the Snarky Puppy versions! It just wouldn’t fit in, thus my slightly less marvelous performance of the chorus. 

  There was quite a bit of internal debate as to whether I ought to censor the N-word. My usage of it would be in response to a quote of MF Doom in The New Yorker’s article, “The Mask Of Metal Face Doom” where he refers to “Chinese niggers”. I was convinced by Lovin’ MC to mute it out, although on any day I am willing to talk in person about problematic slurs against my people. 

  The last line is from Howl’s Moving Castle. This song is largely a note to myself.
